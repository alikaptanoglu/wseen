<p class="p2"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Last Revised: Jun 13, 2022&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Welogger (&ldquo;Welogger,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information that is collected through our Service, as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>How We Collect and Use Information</strong></p>
<p class="p1">We collect the following types of information about you:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Device Information: When you download and use the Welogger, we may collect your device information such as your operating system, device model, os version, ip address. We do not collect/store neither your mobile phone number nor any other phone number you add. We may also collect billing information when you sign up for Premium service. If you remove your account from Welogger, we destroy all data.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Sharing of Your Information</strong></p>
<p class="p1">We may share your personal information with our third-party business partners, vendors and consultants who perform services on our behalf or who help us provide our Services, such as cloud systems, marketing or analytic services.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Except as described above, we will not disclose personal information to third parties (including law enforcement, other government entity, or civil litigant; excluding our subcontractors) unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if in our sole discretion, we determine it is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any claims or allegations, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Welogger, our Users or others.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>How we protect your information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Welogger cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect and that we share with our service providers. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Your Choices About Your Information</strong></p>
<p class="p1">You may, of course, decline to submit any personal information through the Service, in which case Welogger may not be able to provide its Services to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Modifying Your Account Information and Settings: You may modify your account information, update or amend your personal information, or change your number at any time by contacting us at yotfb8181@gmail.com. We make every effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests. As noted above, you may not opt out of Service-related communications (e.g., account verification, parental consent notification, order confirmations, change or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying your account information, you can contact us directly at yotfb8181@gmail.com&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Our Service allows parents to keep track of their children&rsquo;s location on mobile devices that the Parent has added to the Family account. The Service is intended to be used by children under 18 only with significant parental involvement and approval. If a Parent wishes to add a User who is under 18 to the Family account, the Parent must first complete the Parental Consent Form and return it via mail, fax or email. The Parental consent form can be found here&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Links to Other Web Sites and Services</strong></p>
<p class="p1">We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link on our website, are subject to that third party&rsquo;s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Welogger may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the policy, we will update the &lsquo;last modified&rsquo; date at the top of this page.
